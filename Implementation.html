<h2>Computer Architecture Implementation</h2>
<p>
Once an instruction set and micro-architecture have been designed, a practical machine must be developed. This design process is called the 
implementation. Implementation is usually not considered architectural design, but rather hardware design engineering. Implementation can be 
further broken down into several steps:

<th>Logic implementation</th><th>Circuit implementation</th><th>Physical implementation</th><th>Design validation</th>
<tr>
<td>designs the circuits required at a logic-gate level</td>
<td>does transistor-level designs of basic elements (e.g., gates, multiplexers, latches) as well as of some larger blocks (ALUs, caches etc.) 
that may be implemented at the log-gate level, or even at the physical level if the design calls for it.</td>
<td>draws physical circuits. The different circuit components are placed in a chip floorplan or on a board and the wires connecting them are created.</td>
<td>tests the computer as a whole to see if it works in all situations and all timings. Once the design validation process starts, the design at 
the logic level are tested using logic emulators. However, this is usually too slow to run realistic test.</td>
